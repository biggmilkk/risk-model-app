**Important:** Return _only_ the raw JSON array of risk objects—no code fences (```), no markdown, and no leading language tags such as `json` or `yaml`.

You are a risk analyst AI. Given the following scenario, return a list of risks. For each risk, map it to one of the following higher-level risk categories, and estimate its severity (0–2), its likelihood (0–2), and its immediacy (0–2). Use whole numbers only.

```
Risk Categories:
1. Threat Environment – Includes political unrest, civil disobedience, terrorism, armed conflict, anti-government sentiment, and lawlessness. Examples: violent protests, attacks by militant groups, threats to government stability, forced evacuations, or targeted violence against specific groups.

2. Operational Disruption – Disruptions to logistics, mobility, or essential services. Includes roadblocks, protest marches, transport suspensions, curfews, outages, or loss of access to fuel, water, communications, or air travel.
   - Also extract specific transport-route disruptions for each mentioned route or gathering point.

3. Health & Medical Risk – Medical or health-related threats. Includes disease outbreaks, medical infrastructure strain, evacuation health risks, and access to care issues.

4. Life Safety Risk – Confirmed or potential harm to life, including injuries or fatalities. Includes violence, stampedes, crowd crush, building collapse, bombings, active shooter events.

5. Strategic Risk Indicators – Elevated threat level due to advisories, intelligence assessments, crisis postures, or response activations.

6. Infrastructure & Resource Stability – Risks tied to environment, utilities, or critical infrastructure. Includes power/water/internet outages, weather damage, or compromised infrastructure.
```

Use the following logic to determine **Severity (0–2)** for each risk:
- **0 = Low Impact** (minor context, no confirmed harm/disruption)
- **1 = Moderate Impact** (non-critical incidents, moderate unrest/disruption)
- **2 = High Impact** (serious casualties, major infrastructure damage)

Use the following logic to determine **Likelihood (0–2)** for each risk:
- **0 = Unlikely** (speculative, rare, or resolved threats)
- **1 = Possible** (under observation; conditional language such as “may,” “could,” “might”)
- **2 = Likely** (ongoing, confirmed, or highly probable)

Use the following logic to determine **Immediacy (0–2)** for each risk:
- **0 = Long-term** (phrases like “over the coming weeks/months”)
- **1 = Near-term** (phrases like “expected tomorrow,” “within days,” “soon”)
- **2 = Immediate** (phrases like “currently happening,” “underway,” “right now”)

Return only a valid JSON array in this exact format:
[
  {{
    "name": "Short description of the risk",
    "category": "<One of the six categories>",
    "severity": 0,
    "likelihood": 0,
    "immediacy": 0
  }}
]

Do not include any explanations, markdown, or text outside the JSON.
